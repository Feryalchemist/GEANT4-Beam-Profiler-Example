This code is my attempt to simulate PEPITES beam profiler using GEANT4. It consists of two ionization chamber like configuration with oposing electric field one another. The protons move from one side of the profiler hiting nanometer thickness gold-layered kapton that creates secondary particle. The secondary particle will move due to electrical field toward the opposite gold-layered kapton that are segmented. 

One chamber has x axis segmented electrode while the other has y axis segmented electrode. The coincidence between combination of two chambers' segment will map the particle intensity on those lateral section.
